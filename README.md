# Network Analysis 2022 @University of Amsterdam

## Course Description
In this course, we learn different network analytical techiniques that can be applied to psychological research.
Special attention is given to the link between research question, data structure, analysis pipeline, and inference. <br>
At  the  end  of  the  course we are  equipped  with  a  ‘network  analytical  toolbox’,  consisting  of  both 
practical  knowledge  (‘how  to’)  as  well  as  critical  questions  and  reflections  on  the  use  of  network  analysis  in 
general (‘why’) and the link between research question and analysis in particular. <br>

Topics cover both theoretical and practical aspects of network analysis including:
 + Theoretical foundation of network analysis
 + R packages for network modeling 
 + Causal network models and Pairwise Markov Random Fields (PMRF)
 + Network estimation from time series data
 + Simulating network dynamics and interventions
